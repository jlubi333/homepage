title: About Me
---

Hi, I'm Justin Philip Lubin! I love computer science, math, playing the piano, fencing, and
crochet. Most of all though, I am passionate about education: not just learning
great things for myself, but also teaching and sharing what I know with others.

I aspire to be a professor of computer science so that I will be able to combine
two of my strongest passions: theoretical computer science and teaching---I am
just as motivated and inspired by teaching others as I am by being on the
cutting edge of research.

I just hope that one day I will be able to pay off the debt of gratitude that I
have to all the wonderful people who have taught me in my life by passing on the
knowledge that they have imparted to me to the next generation.

Some quick facts about me:

- I've loved programming ever since I was in seventh grade. My current favorite
  programming language is [Elm][elm], which is a joy to work with! I also
  really like Haskell, Python, and C; Haskell for its beauty, Python for its
  convenience, and C for its speed.
- My favorite classical music composers are Frédéric Chopin, Ludwig van
  Beethoven, Johann Sebastian Bach, Camille Saint-Saëns, and Sergei
  Rachmaninoff.  My favorite piece is Beethoven's [Piano Sonata No. 32 in C
  Minor, Op.  111][sonata].

If you like what I write (for some weird reason...), then you should check out
my [portfolio][portfolio] and my [GitHub account][github]. I'm also on
[LinkedIn][linkedin], if you're curious.

Thanks for stopping by!

      <div class="post">
        <p>Hi, I’m Justin Philip Lubin! I love computer science, math, playing the piano, fencing, and
crochet. Most of all though, I am passionate about education: not just learning
great things for myself, but also teaching and sharing what I know with others.</p>
<p>I aspire to be a professor of computer science so that I will be able to combine
two of my strongest passions: theoretical computer science and teaching—I am
just as motivated and inspired by teaching others as I am by being on the
cutting edge of research.</p>
<p>I just hope that one day I will be able to pay off the debt of gratitude that I
have to all the wonderful people who have taught me in my life by passing on the
knowledge that they have imparted to me to the next generation.</p>
<p>Some quick facts about me:</p>
<ul>
<li>I’ve loved programming ever since I was in seventh grade. My current favorite
programming language is <a href="http://elm-lang.org/">Elm</a>, which is a joy to work with! I also
really like Haskell, Python, and C; Haskell for its beauty, Python for its
convenience, and C for its speed.</li>
<li>My favorite classical music composers are Frédéric Chopin, Ludwig van
Beethoven, Johann Sebastian Bach, Camille Saint-Saëns, and Sergei
Rachmaninoff.  My favorite piece is Beethoven’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YE2iyBRmA_g">Piano Sonata No. 32 in C
Minor, Op.  111</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you like what I write (for some weird reason…), then you should check out
my <a href="/portfolio">portfolio</a> and my <a href="https://github.com/justinlubin/">GitHub account</a>. I’m also on
<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-philip-lubin">LinkedIn</a>, if you’re curious.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by!</p>
